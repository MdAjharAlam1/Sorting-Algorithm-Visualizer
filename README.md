A sorting algorithm visualizer project is a tool that allows users to see how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing the sorting process step by step. This type of project is often used for educational purposes to help students and developers understand how various sorting algorithms function and compare their efficiency.

Features:

Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from a variety of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

Array Generation: Users can generate random arrays of various sizes to be sorted.

Visualization: The sorting process is visualized step by step, showing how elements are swapped or moved in each iteration.

Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to see the sorting process in slow motion or at a faster pace.

Algorithm Analysis: Some visualizers provide information about the number of comparisons and swaps performed by each algorithm, helping users understand their efficiency.

Color Coding: Visualizers often use color coding to highlight the elements being compared or swapped, making it easier to follow the sorting process.

Reset and Replay: Users can reset the array and replay the sorting process with the same or different algorithm.

Responsive Design: The visualizer is designed to work well on different screen sizes, allowing users to access it from desktops, laptops, or mobile devices.

User Interaction:

Select Algorithm: Choose the sorting algorithm you want to visualize.

Generate Array: Generate a random array of numbers to be sorted.

Visualize Sorting: Start the visualization to see how the selected algorithm sorts the array.

Adjust Speed: Use the speed control to adjust the pace of the visualization.

Reset and Replay: Reset the array and replay the sorting process with the same or different algorithm.

Compare Algorithms: Compare the performance of different algorithms by visualizing them on the same array.

How It Works:

Initialization: The visualizer initializes with a default sorting algorithm and a random array.

Visualization Loop: The visualizer enters a loop where it repeatedly applies the sorting algorithm to the array and updates the visualization to reflect the changes.

Sorting Process: The sorting algorithm sorts the array by comparing and swapping elements as per its logic.

Visualization Update: After each iteration of the sorting algorithm, the visualization is updated to show the current state of the array.

User Interaction: During the visualization, users can interact with the controls to adjust the speed, reset the array, or change the sorting algorithm.

Completion: Once the sorting process is complete, the visualizer displays a message indicating that the array has been sorted, along with any relevant statistics about the sorting process.
